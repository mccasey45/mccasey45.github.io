    <title> Top 5 Horror Movies of Eighties</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Top 5 Horror movies of the Eighties(that frightened me as a child)!</h1>
   
    <main>
	<div>
	<p>
	In 1980 I turned 6 years old. I had just gotten old enough to start to watch and understand that movies were fun and make-believe adventures (like 'The Smurfs and the Magic Flute' movie released in the US in 1983).
	BUT...one night, when I was supposed to go to bed while my older brother and his friends watched 'Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter', I secretly stayed up and watched it with them, peaking over a half-wall where I could see downstairs to the television. I found out movies weren't always so fun and could give you nightmares!
	
	</p>
	<p>
	Of course nowadays, I know that these horror movies can be fun, but back then I wasn't so sure! So these are my Top 5 Horror movies of the 1980's that gave me nightmares then and are still good today. To be clear - there are MANY great horror movies of the 1980s not on this list that I even like better than these 5! But these specifically I watched as a kid and they frightened me more than any others! See full list criteria below.

					<p>
					This is the one that started it all. A ten year old should not be allowed to watch this (yes I disobeyed my parents to watch it, yes I got in trouble when I told my mother the reason i couldn't fall asleep). If you enjoy slasher movies, this is one of the better ones and an iconic end to the initial run of the killer, Jason.

                    </figure>
					<p>
					The movie begins with a bunch of children killing a restaurant full of adults (some in horrific manner). How and why would kids kills their parents, uncles adults (I loved mine). Only fitting when you found out the Devil was behind it all!

                    </figure>
					<p>
					This movie is great on many levels and still one of my favorite movies of all time (not just horror). The werewolf transformation scene is worth the price of admission and blew my poor little mind as a child.

                    </figure>   
					<p>
					The movie poster alone scared me and when I was finally able to watch it, the slapstick comedy it had did not alleve the horror of the everything else in the movie! This is a made-in-Michigan winner for horror fans, but beware, the over-the-top gore could be too much for some.

					I watched the edited, TV version of the movie...And it STILL scared me! This is the ghost story of the list...and I still get a little nervous when I see fog rolling in...

		Have you seen any of these movies? Did they scare you to? If you haven't seen them, give them a watch, i think you'll enjoy them, but be forewarned, don't watch them alone!
